## Overview

Giver-trail is an app that is intended to connect outdoors enthusiasts such as hikers, bikers, and climbers with causes they care about.  Users initiate geo-tracking functionality in the app when they go out along their trail or journey.  As they move, they accumulate points based on their horizontal and vertical distance travelled.  

Users select causes from a list that they feel most connected with, and are then able to make points donations to these causes.  The idea that ties all of this together is the intention that sponsoring corporations would donate a certain 'cash equivalent' amount to the given causes for the points that the user gives.

## Installation

To use this application, you will need to have the react-native cli as well as xcode and an ios (or android) simulator installed on your system.  THe associated backend for this app will also need to be set up.  It is found under the repository giver-trail-backend.

To run the app, use:

* ```npm install``` to install the dependencies.

* ```react-native run-ios``` to run the application on ios.

* ```react-native run-android``` to run the application on android.

## Usage

This app has been made with an offline first approach, using redux-persist within redux-offline.  The mapping implementation was made with MapBox and geolocation is persisted in the background with a background timer.  GiverTrail is a work in progress that should only be used for personal use cases and should not be used or expanded upon for commercial purposes unless explicitly speciefied by written consent from the author.
