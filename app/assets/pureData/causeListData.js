    description:
      "The northern spotted owl primarily inhabits old growth forests in the northern part of its range (Canada to southern Oregon) and landscapes with a mix of old and younger forest types in the southern part of its range (Klamath region and California). The subspecies range is the Pacific coast from extreme southern British Columbia to Marin County in northern California. It nests in cavities or on platforms in large trees and will use abandoned nests of other species. Spotted owls form long-term pair bonds (divorce is an uncommon occurrence) and remain in the same geographical areas year after year. Most spotted owls occur on US federal lands (Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service lands), although significant numbers occur on state lands in all three states, and on private and tribal properties."

      "Canadian Organic Growers (COG) is a national charitable organization (13014 0494 RR0001) with members in all regions of Canada. COG is connected to the regions through eight regional Chapters, four affiliated organizations, and to the international organic community through membership in the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM).  COG's membership is diverse and includes farmers, gardeners, processors, retailers, educators, policy-makers, and consumers. Not all COG members run certified organic operations, but they share a vision for a sustainable bioregionally-based organic food system. Our members believe that organic food production is the best choice for the health of consumers and producers, for the protection and enhancement of the environment, and for the sustainability of the food production system. In fact we believe that the survival of our country and even of the planet depends on it."

      "The Access to Quality Education in Rural Uganda project involves constructing 60 new primary schools and boosting enrolment at 450 existing schools. Specific project activities include: identifying 60 communities with at least 300 OOSC (ages 4-14) who lack access to any existing permanent school infrastructure within a 2.5 km radius; funding the construction of 60 primary schools in the communities identified with donations of land and labour from the local community; leveraging resources to obtain a commitment from the Ugandan Ministry of Education & Sports to recruit, post, and finance teachers for each school and provide in-kind support for classroom furniture and resources; opening 60 primary schools to enrol at least 190 students per school within two years; and recruiting and placing 150 Building Tomorrow Fellows – recent graduates of Ugandan universities – in existing schools to provide direct support to Head Teachers and School Management Committees.

      "The primary goal of Canada’s forest conservation and protection efforts is to preserve the health of this country’s wide range of forest ecosystems. In Canada, forest land outside formal protected areas is safeguarded by the laws, regulations and policies that all provinces, territories and the federal government have developed to enforce sustainable forest management across the country. Because 94% of Canada’s forests are on publicly owned land, this means that preserving forest ecosystem health is a shared responsibility and commitment of sustainable forest management Canada-wide."
